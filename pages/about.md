About page content

Create pages in `pages/` folder. 
To include them in the navbar, add front matter option `nav` with the text you want to be displayed, e.g. `nav: Demo`.
Alternatively, if `nav: true` page will show up in navbar using the page `title`.
Use `nav_order` to control order of pages in the navbar.
